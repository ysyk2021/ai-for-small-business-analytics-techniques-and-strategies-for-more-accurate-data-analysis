Prescriptive analytics is a field of data analysis that uses AI to recommend actions or decisions based on data insights. In this chapter, we will discuss the different AI applications for prescriptive analytics in small businesses.

Predictive vs. Prescriptive Analytics

Before diving into the AI applications for prescriptive analytics, it's essential to distinguish between predictive and prescriptive analytics. Predictive analytics uses historical data to forecast future events or trends while prescriptive analytics goes one step further by recommending specific actions or decisions based on those predictions.

For example, predictive analytics may be used to forecast customer demand for a product, while prescriptive analytics would recommend the optimal pricing strategy to maximize profits based on that demand forecast.
